# CS370-Pirate-Intelligent-Agent
Pirate Intelligent Agent (Jupyter Notebook)

This term at SNHU has been a good one. I have to say overall I enjoyed this class. It was fun learning about artificial intelligence methods and machine learning. Thing like suervised and reinforcement learning that I never knew much about. 

For this intelligent agent problem, I was given a majority of code but had to come up with the q training algorithm of the code. This algorithm had to navigate the pirate through the maze to find the treasure at the end. The code took took the pirate on several paths, and learned each path, which way was better and faster. It did this through a type of reinformcent learning, where it was penalized for hitting a filled sqaure or the walls of the maze, and rewarded for moving into an empty square. It was trying to complete the maze with the most maximized reward

This course and project was a crucial part of "emerging trends" in computer science because there is so many products that are releveant to today's time that include part of artificial intelligence, such as Apple's Siri in our iphones or google's google assisant.

As a computer scientist, there are different ways to approach a problem. I think we all come up with a list of steps, or a general basis that we all try to follow, yet I think ever developer or computer programmer appraoches them differently. He is my approach personally. I start by identifying the problem. What caused the problem? I next begin to research the problem and ask myself if there is other instances of this previosuly I can learn from. Then I move onto how can I fix it, and what tools can I use to do so. Once fixed I have a mindset of, is this really fixed? and test to verify. 

Ethics is a big topic in computer science. I think the biggest ethics topic in arttificial intelligence is privacy and data protection. User tend to give AI much personal information and we have to be able to garuntee them that that inforamtion is protected. 

It's been a great term with much learned at SNHU
